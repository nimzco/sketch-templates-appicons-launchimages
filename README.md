Simple Sketch templates for AppIcon and LaunchImage. Drop your images, export and you're done.  
I disposed the artboards in order to know where to drop them in Xcode.

# Sketch templates for iOS / XCode AppIcons and LaunchImages

## Why?

Because I had a hard time figuring out how those image sizes works.

## LaunchImage

![LaunchImage](https://github.com/nimzco/sketch-templates-appicons-launchimages/raw/master/img/LaunchImage.png "LaunchImage")

## AppIcon

![AppIcon](https://github.com/nimzco/sketch-templates-appicons-launchimages/raw/master/img/AppIcon.png "AppIcon")

## TODO 

- Add other templates for AppleTV & iPad
